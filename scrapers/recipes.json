In this recipe, you can substitute 3/4 teaspoon cinnamon, 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg, and 1/8 teaspoon each of ginger and cloves for the pumpkin pie spice.\n\nSafety Tip: You can be sure your skillet or griddle is hot enough for pancakes without burning your hand. Just sprinkle a few (3 or 4) drops of water on the surface. If they dance and sizzle, you are ready to cook. Be sure handles of skillets and pans are always turned toward the center or back of the stove, to prevent the pan from catching on hands or clothes and causing burns.\n\nLearn more about:\n\nPumpkin",
